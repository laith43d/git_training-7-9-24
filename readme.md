this session is about half way through the course and I am going to be talking about the basics of the course. I will be going over the basics of the course, the syllabus, and the schedule. I will also be going over the topics that I have already covered in the class.

In Git, the terms **working directory** and **working tree** are often used interchangeably, but they refer to different aspects of your local repository. Here's the distinction between the two:

1. **Working Directory**:
   - This refers to the directory on your file system where Git is initialized (i.e., where the `.git` directory is present). It is the root folder of your project where you actively work, and it contains all your files and subdirectories.
   - Essentially, it's the part of your project you are working on and editing directly. These changes aren't automatically reflected in your Git history unless you stage or commit them.

2. **Working Tree**:
   - The working tree includes the working directory **and** any tracked files that are currently checked out from your Git repository. It refers to the actual files on your file system that Git is tracking, as they appear at any given commit.
   - The working tree changes as you switch branches or check out different commits, and it reflects the version of your files according to the current state of your repository.

### Summary:
- **Working Directory**: The actual folder where your project resides, containing all files and directories.
- **Working Tree**: The version of your files that Git tracks, corresponding to a specific commit or branch checked out.
